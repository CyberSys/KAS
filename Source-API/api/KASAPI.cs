// This module is used to build API assembly. Once released to the public the version of this
// assembly cannot change. This guarantees that all the dependent mods will be able to load it. In
// case of a new version of API is released it must inherit from the previous version, and become a
// completely new assembly that is supplied together with the old versions.
//
// It's unspecified how many old versions of the API are to be preserved in the distribution. Mods
// developers should migrate to the newest available API version as soon as possible. In a normal
// case, the every following version is an ancestor of the previous version(s), so the migration
// should be trivial. However, in case of there is some methods/interfaces deprecation, an extra
// work may be required to migrate.

// Name of the namespace denotes the API version.
