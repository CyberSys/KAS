# Documentation site for KAS API

This site holds documentation for several versions, since different versions of library can be used by different mods. It's highly encouraged to use the latest available version in development. However, if the mod uses a legacy version and upgrading is not an option, the old documentation can help.

Versions:

* [KAS API v2](APIv2)

The documentation can be accessed via [GitHub Pages](https://ihsoft.github.io/KAS/).
